# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This system processes UAV flight logs from multiple formats (.tlog, .bin, .rlog, .txt) to create clean, time-aligned datasets for training Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) that reduce GPS position error. The system extracts sensor data, performs sensor fusion, generates ground-truth positions, and outputs structured training datasets.
